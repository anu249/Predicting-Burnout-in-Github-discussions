# Predicting-Burnout-in-Github-discussions

**Overview**
This project aims to predict burnout in GitHub discussions using machine learning techniques. Burnout among contributors is a prevalent issue in open-source communities, affecting productivity and well-being. By analyzing the patterns of communication within GitHub discussions, we can develop models to identify potential burnout indicators early on.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project can be found in the dataset powertoys_2021_10 (1) (1).json. It contains anonymized GitHub discussion data, including text of discussions, timestamps, and metadata. Before running the notebook, ensure that you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the appropriate directory.

**Getting Started**
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

**Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Predicting-Burnout-in-Github-discussions.git

**Download Dependencies:**
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open Jupyter Notebook:
Navigate to the project directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

**jupyter notebook**
Run the Notebook:
Open the AI_final.ipynb notebook and execute each cell sequentially. Ensure to check the path of the dataset after loading it into the notebook.

**Results**
By running the notebook, you will obtain insights into the burnout prediction model's performance and understand the key features contributing to the prediction.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in identifying burnout indicators within GitHub discussions. By leveraging this predictive model, open-source communities can proactively address burnout issues and promote a healthier environment for contributors.
